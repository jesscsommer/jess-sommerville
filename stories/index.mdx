I’ve always enjoyed making something out of nothing. That started as an interest in creative writing that followed me throughout my life. I loved fighting against the blank page – and myself – to create something that I was proud of. While I entered college as an English major, I soon sought out more ways to create – data visualization, introductory programming, entrepreneurship. I entered the tech industry through digital media and design, UX writing, and technical product support.

During my time in product support, I worked at a no-code startup called Bubble. The company produces an app builder with a drag-and-drop editor and a spreadsheet-like database management interface. My time there brought me closer to software engineering and taught me the fundamentals of web development, even before I’d written a line of JavaScript. This led me to decide to deepen my technical knowledge and enroll at Flatiron School for full-stack software engineering.

Now I build for the internet out of the same fire that got me here in the first place – that thrill of the highs and lows of the creative process, of making something tangible, with tangible results. I’m happiest when I’m learning something new, building something with it, then writing it down. Preferably while listening to the same song on repeat for days on end, on end, on end.
